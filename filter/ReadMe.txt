
OpenGL 4.3 Compute Shader image filter example

This demo exercises OpenGL 4.3 compute shaders to implement image filters.

Implemented filters:
*  general convolution
*  separable convolution
*  median filter

The linear filters support Gaussian, uniform, and Sobel horizontal and
vertical kernels.
